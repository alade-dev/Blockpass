## Introduction

**Project Overview:**
BlockPass is a pioneering decentralized platform built on the Scroll blockchain, revolutionizing event ticketing through the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Chainlink price feeds. Our mission is to address the prevalent issues of ticket scalping, price manipulation, and counterfeit tickets that plague the traditional event ticketing industry.

## Problem Statement

The traditional event ticketing industry suffers from various challenges, including unfair ticket pricing, lack of transparency, and counterfeit ticketing. These issues often lead to frustrated fans, inflated ticket prices, and a lack of trust in ticketing systems.

## Solution

BlockPass provides a decentralized solution to these problems by leveraging blockchain technology and integrating Chainlink price feeds. Our platform ensures transparent and fair ticket pricing, prevents scalping, and guarantees the authenticity of event tickets.

## Key Features

1. **Transparent Pricing:** Dynamic ticket pricing based on real-time market conditions, thanks to Chainlink price feeds.
2. **Fair Access:** Unique NFT-based tickets and a first-come-first-served model prevent scalpers and ensure fair access for genuine fans.
3. **Immutable Records:** All ticket transactions are recorded on the blockchain, creating a transparent and tamper-proof ledger of ticket ownership and sales history.

## Integration with Chainlink

BlockPass integrates Chainlink price feeds to enable dynamic pricing of event passes. This ensures that pass prices remain fair and reflect current market conditions.

## The Graph Protocol Integration

To index and query data efficiently, BlockPass utilizes the Graph Protocol. This enables seamless access to blockchain data, enhancing the user experience and enabling powerful analytics.

## Motivation

The motivation behind BlockPass stems from real-world challenges highlighted in articles like [this CBC News report](https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/concert-tickets-broken-1.7185987), which exposes the broken nature of the current event ticketing system. Instances of ticket scalping, inflated prices, and counterfeit tickets have disillusioned fans and undermined the integrity of the live entertainment industry. BlockPass aims to restore trust and fairness to event ticketing by providing a decentralized alternative that prioritizes transparency, accessibility, and authenticity.

## Impact

BlockPass aims to disrupt the event ticketing industry, empowering organizers, artists, and attendees alike. By eliminating intermediaries, reducing ticket fraud, and ensuring fair pricing, we are reshaping the future of event ticketing for the better.

## Future Outlook

We envision a future where event ticketing is decentralized, transparent, and accessible to all. Through continuous innovation and community collaboration, BlockPass is committed to leading the charge towards a more inclusive and equitable event ecosystem.

## Saving Lives Through Fair Ticketing

Beyond revolutionizing event ticketing, BlockPass has the potential to save lives. Imagine a scenario where a critical public health announcement or emergency evacuation notice is disseminated through a live event. In the traditional ticketing model, the dissemination of such vital information could be hindered by scalpers, ticket fraud, or unfair access. However, with BlockPass, the transparent and fair ticketing system ensures that genuine fans have equal access to event tickets, enabling timely and efficient communication of critical information. By providing a platform where organizers can reach their audience without hindrance, BlockPass contributes to a safer and more connected society, potentially saving lives in emergency situations.
