Welcome to the BlockPass smart contract repository! BlockPass is a decentralized platform on the Scroll blockchain for creating and managing block passes tickets, implemented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) following the ERC721 standard.

## Features

- Organizers can create and manage block passes for various events.
- Users can purchase block passes by acquiring NFTs.
- Block passes have attributes such as metadata, category, maximum pass count, pass price, start time, and sales end time.
- Secure handling of pass sales through blockchain transactions.
- Organizers receive the proceeds from pass sales, with a small fee deducted for platform maintenance.
- Users can track their acquired block passes and view events they've created.
- Events can be categorized, and users can search for events based on categories.
- Block passes can be removed by the organizer if no passes have been sold.

### Usage
#### Creating a New Pass
To create a new pass on BlockPass, organizers can follow these steps:

1. Connect your Scroll wallet to the BlockPass platform.
2. Navigate to the "Create New Pass" section.
3. Fill in the details of the pass, including maximum pass count, start time, sales end time, initial pass price, metadata, and category.
4. Confirm the creation of the pass, and it will be deployed on the blockchain.

#### Purchasing a Pass
To purchase a pass on BlockPass as an attendee, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Scroll wallet to the BlockPass platform.
2. Browse the available passes and select the desired pass.
3. Review the pass details, including pricing and availability.
4. Click "Purchase Pass" and confirm the transaction using your wallet.
5. Upon successful purchase, the pass will be minted as an NFT in your wallet.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Prices of passes are dynamically adjusted based on real-time market conditions using Chainlink price feeds.
- **Fair Access:** Unique NFT-based passes prevent scalping and ensure fair access for genuine fans.
- **Immutable Records:** All ticket transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing fraud.

### Chainlink Integration
BlockPass integrates Chainlink price feeds to enable dynamic pricing of event passes. The `updateFeedPrice` function in the smart contract retrieves real-time asset prices from Chainlink oracles and adjusts the pass price accordingly. This ensures that pass prices remain fair and reflect current market conditions.
