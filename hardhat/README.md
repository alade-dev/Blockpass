### Key Features
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Prices of passes are dynamically adjusted based on real-time market conditions using Chainlink price feeds.
- **Fair Access:** Unique NFT-based passes prevent scalping and ensure fair access for genuine fans.
- **Immutable Records:** All ticket transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing fraud.

### Chainlink Integration
BlockPass integrates Chainlink price feeds to enable dynamic pricing of event passes. The `updateFeedPrice` function in the smart contract retrieves real-time asset prices from Chainlink oracles and adjusts the pass price accordingly. This ensures that pass prices remain fair and reflect current market conditions.
